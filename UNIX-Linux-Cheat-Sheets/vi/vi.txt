:w     save (don't quit)  [:w filename saves to filename]
:q     save and quit
:q!    quit (don't save)
:x     save if a change has been made, quit regardless
ZZ     same as :x

Some vi Settings
----------------

:set autoindent       Automatically indent at the same level as the line above.
:set number           Display line numbers.
:set showmode         Indicate if vi is in insert mode.
:set wrapmargin=n     Automatically wrap word in last n columns.
:set wrapscan         Searches reaching the bottom continue from the top.

To unset any of these options, use the prefix no. For instance, the command :set 
nowrapscan will turn off the wrapscan feature. To make settings permanent, place 
them in the file .exrc in your home directory.
